# feature-selection-4ways

Do feature selection in 4 different ways: 1) rank models by AICc, 2) leave one out or k-fold cross validation, 3) Bayesian variable selection, and 4) use caret's recursive feature elimination. For better or worse, they all give different answers (at least predicting mpg with mtcars dataset).
