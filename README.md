# model-selection-4ways

Do variable selection in different ways: 1) rank models by AICc, 2) leave one out cross validation, 3) Bayesian variable selection, and 4) use caret's recursive feature elimination. For better or worse, they all give different answers (at least predicting mpg with mtcars dataset).
